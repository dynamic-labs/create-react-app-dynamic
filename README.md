# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and it has [Dynamic](https://dynamic.xyz) integrated out of the box!

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dynamic-labs/create-react-app-dynamic
```

2. Install dependancies

```bash
npm i
# or
yarn
```

3. Add your env variable

Rename `.env.example` to `.env.local` and add your Dynamic Project ID as the value of the `DYNAMIC_PROJECT_ID` variable.
You can find your Dynamic project ID in the [developer section of your dashboard](https://app.dynamic.xyz/dashboard/developer).

4. Run the development server:
